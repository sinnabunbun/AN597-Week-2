### Mod 3

"While Linux and Mac OSX both include SSH as part of the base system, Windows does not. As a result the standard Windows distribution of git (Msysgit, referenced above) also includes an SSH client."  
  
  - Unsure what this means, ask for clarification.  
    + is this the same as creating an rsa key?  
  
### Mod 4

# Matrices  

- a matrix is a collection of vectors  
- it can only store one kind of vector at a time (ie. characters vs numerical)  
  + `m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)`  
  + _example of matrix function_
- the matrix is filled by column normally but if you want to manually make it by row (left to right instead of up to down) insert the argument  
  + `m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow=TRUE)`  
- you can also make a matrix by combining two vectors  
  + `v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)`  
  + `v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)`  
  + `m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)`  
  + `m1`  
  + _to combine these two as columns you would use the function `cbind()` instead
